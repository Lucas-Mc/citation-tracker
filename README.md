# Citation Tracker

The goal is to create a reusable tool for tracking use of LCP resources in research papers. e.g. So we can answer the questions, "which research papers were carried out with the use of MIMIC" and "which research papers were carried out with the use of the eICU Collaborative Research Database"?
